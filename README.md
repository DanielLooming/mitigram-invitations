# AddressBook
This project created by Daniel as part of the Mitigram interview proccess .

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server(npm install may be needed before that). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Note: I have not played with the unit testing part of the app, the spec files are part of Angular's practice in generating components, so they need further work .
